**5 new desirable functionlities**

1] Implement a feature that allows students to form study groups within the app to collaborate on assignments, discuss course materials, and plan study sessions together.

2] Create a virtual classroom environment within the app that allows teachers to deliver live lectures, organise interactive discussions, and arrange real-time Q&A sessions with students.

3] Create a feature that analyses students' learning preferences, skills, and areas for development, then generates personalized learning routes based on each student's unique needs and goals.

4] Create a part of the app dedicated to career resources, such as job postings, internship possibilities, resume-building tools, and career counselling services, to help students effortlessly move from academics to the workforce.

5] Allow students to submit course evaluations immediately through the app at the end of each semester or course. This feature simplifies the course evaluation process, boosts participation rates, and gives teachers vital feedback to improve course content, delivery, and overall teaching effectiveness.
